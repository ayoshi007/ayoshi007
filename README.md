### Hi, I'm Akihiro Yoshimoto!
This GitHub profile serves as my portfolio, where I'll be placing my personal projects.

I'm interested in machine learning, embedded systems, operating systems, and a little bit of game development.

Right now, I'm working on a C++ minesweeper clone with a terminal UI to learn about developing C++ projects.
