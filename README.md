### Hi!

Things I want to look into:
- Go, Rust, C++, Lua
- Compilers, Interpreters, Programming Language design
- Parallel systems, distributed systems
- Linear algebra
- WebGL
- Real time web connections (WebSockets and WebRTC, esp. for games)
- C++ SFML
- NixOS
- Understanding the HTTP protocol (and more about networking)
- xv6, exokernels, drivers
- Embedded (saw a very cool video about Micromouse that inspired me)
