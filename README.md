### Hi, I'm Akihiro Yoshimoto!
This GitHub profile serves as my portfolio, where I'll be placing my personal projects.

I'm interested in machine learning, embedded systems, operating systems, and a little bit of game development.

I am not working on any project in particular at the moment, but I am thinking about picking up some web development and machine learning!
