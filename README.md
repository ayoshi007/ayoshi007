### Hi, I'm Akihiro Yoshimoto!
This GitHub profile serves as my portfolio, where I'll be placing my personal projects.

I'm interested in learning more about machine learning, software engineering, graphics programming, game development, and low-level systems (embedded, maybe RTOSes?).
For some of these topics, like ML, graphics, and game dev, I do need more background in foundational concepts like linear algebra and graphics algorithms.

I am currently starting to work on a Python project implementing Conway's Game of Life!
