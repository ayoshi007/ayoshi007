### Hi, I'm Akihiro Yoshimoto!
This GitHub profile serves as my portfolio, where I'll be placing my personal projects.

I'm interested in learning more about machine learning, software engineering, low-level systems (embedded, maybe RTOSes?).
Lately, I've been becoming interested in graphics libraries like Vulkan, and some interesting 'art' like programs like Conway's Game of Life.

I am not working on any project in particular at the moment, but I am thinking about picking up some web development and machine learning!
