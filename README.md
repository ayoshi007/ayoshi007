### Hi!

Things I want to look into:
- Rust, C++, Lua
- Compilers, Interpreters, Programming Language design
- Parallel systems, distributed systems
- WebGL
- Real time web connections (WebSockets and WebRTC, esp. for games)
- C++ SFML
- NixOS
- xv6, exokernels, drivers
- Embedded (saw a very cool video about Micromouse that inspired me)

Things I've looked/am looking into
- Linear algebra (LAFF)
- Understanding the HTTP protocol (writing some programs that parse HTTP from a TCP socket, in Go!)
