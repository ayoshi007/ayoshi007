### Hi, I'm Akihiro Yoshimoto!
Currently working and studying as a part-time graduate student (very sleepy!)

Things I want to look into:
- Go
- Lua for Neovim
- Python web frameworks (Django, FastAPI)
- JavaScript frontends (Vue, HTMX)
- WebGL
- Real time web connections (WebSockets and WebRTC, esp. for games)
- C++ SFML

Things on my radar:
- Rust
- Google Firebase
- Using Docker containers for development
- NixOS
- Learning more about window managers
